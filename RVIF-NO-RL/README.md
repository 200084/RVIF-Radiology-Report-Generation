# R2GenCMN

This is the implementation of [Cross-modal Memory Networks for Radiology Report Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.459/) at ACL-IJCNLP-2021.

## News
- The codebase is kind of old so we refer the readers to this awesome project ([ViLMedic](https://github.com/jbdel/vilmedic)).
- The codes for visualization and clinical efficacy are updated.

## Requirements

- `torch==1.7.1`
- `torchvision==0.8.2`
- `opencv-python==4.4.0.42`

## Download R2GenCMN
You can download the models we trained for each dataset from [here](https://github.com/zhjohnchan/R2GenCMN/blob/main/data/r2gencmn.md).

## Datasets
We use two datasets (IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR) in our paper.

For `IU X-Ray`, you can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0BXEuDy8Cmm2jfN0YYGkQxFZd2ZIoLg/view?usp=sharing) and then put the files in `data/iu_xray`.

For `MIMIC-CXR`, you can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS6NYirOXQf8qYieSVMvqNwuOlgAbM_E/view?usp=sharing) and then put the files in `data/mimic_cxr`. You can apply the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS6NYirOXQf8qYieSVMvqNwuOlgAbM_E/view?usp=sharing) with your license of [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/).

NOTE: The `IU X-Ray` dataset is of small size, and thus the variance of the results is large.
There have been some works using `MIMIC-CXR` only and treating the whole `IU X-Ray` dataset as an extra test set.

## Train

Run `bash train_iu_xray.sh` to train a model on the IU X-Ray data.

Run `bash train_mimic_cxr.sh` to train a model on the MIMIC-CXR data.

## Test

Run `bash test_iu_xray.sh` to test a model on the IU X-Ray data.

Run `bash test_mimic_cxr.sh` to test a model on the MIMIC-CXR data.

Follow [CheXpert](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-cxr/tree/master/txt/chexpert) or [CheXbert](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/CheXbert) to extract the labels and then run `python compute_ce.py`. Note that there are several steps that might accumulate the errors for the computation, e.g., the labelling error and the label conversion. We refer the readers to those new metrics, e.g., [RadGraph](https://github.com/jbdel/rrg_emnlp) and [RadCliQ](https://github.com/rajpurkarlab/CXR-Report-Metric).

## Visualization

Run `bash plot_mimic_cxr.sh` to visualize the attention maps on the MIMIC-CXR data.
